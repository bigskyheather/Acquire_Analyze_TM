# Acquire_Analyze
I chose to analyze the scripts from two workplace sitcoms that were both shot in the mockumentary style, The Office and Parks and Recreation, they also have some commonalities in creators.

I was inspired to do this after listening to an episode of the Office Ladies Podcast (an Office rewatch podcast) where they discussed how someone analyzed the transcripts of their podcast and found the most common word they said was lady.
