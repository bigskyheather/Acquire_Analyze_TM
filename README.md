# Acquire_Analyze
I chose to analyze the scripts from two workplace sitcoms that were both shot in the mockumentary style, The Office and Parks and Recreation, they also have some commonalities in creators.

I was inspired to do this after listening to an episode of the Office Ladies Podcast (an Office rewatch podcast) where they discussed how someone analyzed the transcripts of their podcast and found the most common word they said was lady.

Thanks for the background here. Interesting to know where the idea came from. 

Very nice work on this analysis and write-up. Most people just wrote code and completely ignored the portion of the assignment that related to writing up. Yours was a happy exception. It would have been interesting to add more analysis along the lines of the group-comparison assignment so we could see which words or phrases "defined" the shows. For instance, "I love you" appears in P&R at a way higher frequency, but that doesn't exactly pop out in your analysis.
